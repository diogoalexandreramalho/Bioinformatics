Instructions for running the Local Alignment algorithm with Matlab:

1) Open Matlab in the folder where 'local_align.m' is.
2) In the Command Window, call the function with the appropriate parameter. Ex:
	[optimal_score, optimal_aligns] = local_align('WPIWPC', 'IIWPI', -4)
3) In the Workspace, open the variable 'optimal_aligns' to observe each of the possible best alignments.




Instructions for running the Global Alignment algorithm with Matlab:

1) Open Matlab in the folder where 'global_align.m' is.
2) In the Command Window, call the function with the appropriate parameter. Ex:
	[optimal_score, optimal_aligns] = local_align('WPIWPC', 'IIWPI', -4)
3) In the Workspace, open the variable 'optimal_aligns' to observe each of the possible best alignments.
